  <h2>About CSTutorBench</h2>
  <p>CSTutorBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the instructional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real-world computer science tutoring scenarios. Built on authentic student–tutor interactions from a foundational university CS course, CSTutorBench captures the complexity of student inquiries and provides rich contextual materials such as project specifications and screenshots.</p>
  <p>Unlike conventional benchmarks that focus narrowly on coding accuracy or generation tasks, CSTutorBench emphasizes pedagogical alignment—assessing how well AI tutors approximate effective human teaching in terms of correctness, clarity, engagement, and more.</p>
